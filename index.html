                        <p class="text">Hello my name is Jeffrey Saari. I'm a 5th year senior at CSUF graduating in December. I'm a simple guy who likes old music and italian food. I am a Christian, a vegan and proud of both. I really enjoy being outside and being active. I love the ocean, spikeball, and backpacking.</p>

                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p class="text">I am the kind of person who likes to learn new skills and experience the world in that way. Some hobbies that I have picked up in my lifetime are playing guitar, coding, and rock climbing. I'm a huge fan of playing sports and I enjoy watching them as well. My favorite musician is Jim Croce because he is an amazing lyricist as well as skilled guitar player.</p>
